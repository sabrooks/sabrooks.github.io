                        <div>
                            <p>This project is a anomaly detection pipeline for time series data of
                                refrigerator temperatures using machine learning methods in the Scikit-Learn library. It
                                firstdefines four classes `Wavelet`, `CompressionDistortion`, `Passthrough`, and `MSE`
                                that are
                                transformers
                                to preprocess the data.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>'Wavelet' class computes wavelet coefficients of the input time series data.
                                </li>
                                <li>`CompressionDistortion` applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the wavelet
                                    coefficients, compresses them into fewer dimensions and then reconstructs the
                                    wavelet coefficients from the compressed data.
                                </li>
                                <li>`Passthrough` is a simple transformer that returns the input as it is.</li>
                                <li>`MSE computes` the mean squared error between the original and the reconstructed
                                    wavelet coefficients, giving a measure of the reconstruction error.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>The script then builds an anomaly detection pipeline that applies these transformations
                                sequentially to the input data. The Pipeline applies these transformations and finally,
                                it uses a
                                SGDClassifier to classify data points as normal or anomalous based on the mean squared
                                error exceeding a certain threshold.

                        <h3>Furnace Detection</h3>
                        <p> The utility marketing team is contemplating a rebate for customers willing to upgrade their
                            gas furnaces
                            to more fuel-efficient models. To do so, they need to identifying which customers possess
                            gas furnaces is
                            a prerequisite. Gas furnaces, typically the most significant gas consumers in Pacific
                            Northwest homes, operate primarily during cold weather. Hence, an analysis of gas
                            consumption patterns relative to temperature can be instrumental in distinguishing customers
                            with and without gas furnaces.
