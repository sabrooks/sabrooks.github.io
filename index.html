                    <h3>Anomaly Detection</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>This project is a anomaly detection pipeline for time series data of
                            refrigerator temperatures using machine learning methods in the Scikit-Learn library. It
                            first
                            defines four classes Wavelet, CompressionDistortion, Passthrough, and MSE that are
                            transformers
                            to preprocess the data.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            'Wavelet' class computes wavelet coefficients of the input time series data.
                            CompressionDistortion
                            applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the wavelet coefficients, compresses them into
                            fewer dimensions and then reconstructs the wavelet coefficients from the compressed data.
                            Passthrough is a simple transformer that returns the input as it is. MSE computes the mean
                            squared error between the original and the reconstructed wavelet coefficients, giving a
                            measure
                            of the reconstruction error.
                        </p>
                        <p>The script then builds an anomaly detection pipeline that applies these transformations
                            sequentially to the input data. The FeatureUnion named pca_original applies the
                            CompressionDistortion and Passthrough transformers in parallel and concatenates their
                            outputs.
                            The Pipeline named anomaly_pipeline applies these transformations and finally, it uses a
                            SGDClassifier to classify data points as normal or anomalous based on the mean squared error
                            exceeding a certain threshold.
