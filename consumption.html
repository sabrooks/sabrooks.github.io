                <h1>Energy Consumption</h1>
                Minute-level energy data from a household electric meter can be used to classify daily
                energy patterns in consumption. The way to classify daily energy patterns is to use
                unsupervised learning methods such as clustering. Clustering algorithms can group similar energy
                consumption patterns together into clusters, which can then be labeled and analyzed. For example,
                k-means clustering can be used to group similar patterns of energy consumption based on their similarity
                in terms of energy usage throughout the day.

One way to classify daily energy patterns is to use unsupervised learning methods such as clustering. Clustering
algorithms can group similar energy consumption patterns together into clusters, which can then be labeled and analyzed.
For example, k-means clustering can be used to group similar patterns of energy consumption based on their similarity in
terms of energy usage throughout the day.
