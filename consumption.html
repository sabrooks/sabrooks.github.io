Minute-level energy data from a household electric meter can be used to classify daily energy patterns in consumption
using various machine learning algorithms and techniques.

One way to classify daily energy patterns is to use unsupervised learning methods such as clustering. Clustering
algorithms can group similar energy consumption patterns together into clusters, which can then be labeled and analyzed.
For example, k-means clustering can be used to group similar patterns of energy consumption based on their similarity in
terms of energy usage throughout the day.
