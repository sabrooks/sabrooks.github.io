                    <strong>Summary</strong>In refrigeration systems, compressor cycles create a recurring pattern in
                    temperature recordings, causing the temperature to oscillate between high and low ranges. Any
                    deviation from this temperature cycle may indicate potential issues with the system. This article
                    presents an anomaly detection algorithm designed to monitor changes in the temperature cycles and
                    generate alerts when abnormalities occur.

                <h3>Wavelet Decomposition </h3>
                <img src="img/cwt.png" alt="Wavelet">
                <p>avelet decomposition is used to transform the temperature waveform into the frequency domain. This
                    technique incorporates historical information into each sample. A typical period is selected for
                    training the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) model.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>PCA Compression and Reconstruction</h3>
                <p> PCA compresses and reconstructs the frequency waveform obtained from the wavelet decomposition.
                    Since the PCA model is trained on a normal operation period, it can efficiently compress and
                    reconstruct the waveform with minimal loss. The more abnormal an observation is, the greater the
                    loss incurred during the compression and reconstruction process.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Mean Squared Error</h3>
                <p> The Mean Squared Error (MSE) quantifies the loss resulting from the PCA compression and
                    reconstruction. Higher MSE values indicate a greater deviation from normal operation.</p>
                <h3>Threshold Setting with Logistic Regression</h3>
                <p>To determine the alarm threshold, a logistic regression model is trained using previous examples of
                    abnormal refrigeration cycles. This threshold helps to differentiate between normal and abnormal
                    operation and trigger alerts when necessary..</p>
