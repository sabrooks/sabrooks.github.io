                    <strong>Summary</strong>: Electric engery meters collect lots of data (a sample a minute in this
                    dataset). The raw data is overwhelming. Processing and modeling is required to extract insights.

                    Household energy consumption habits change by day of the week and season.
                    Energy habits include not just how much energy is used but also the pattern of usage of day.
                    Daily patterns are classified by clusters formed from the daily usage profile. The steps are
                    explained below.

                <h3> Low-Pass Filter </h3>
                <p>Low-pass Filter with cuttof 15 minutes: Smooths trends less than 15 minutes long.
                    Purpose in this application is to reduces the indepence of each minute (each minute will be a
                    feature in the cluster). For our purposes increase usage at 6:03.

                    An alternative would be to downsample to 5 minute intervals.

                <h3>Scaling</h3>
                <p>To minimize the effect of temperature on load,
                    we scale the data to have zero mean and a spread of one. We do this for each day separately to avoid
                    the
                    bias of temperature. Our goal is to identify patterns in energy consumption relative to each other,
                    and not just the
                    total consumption. If we did not scale each day, the result would be very close to a one dimensional
                    clustering on total daily consumption.

                <p>Minute-level energy data from a household electric meter can be used to classify daily
                    energy patterns in consumption. The way to classify daily energy patterns is to use
                    unsupervised learning methods such as clustering. Clustering algorithms can group similar energy
                    consumption patterns together into clusters, which can then be labeled and analyzed. For example,
                    k-means clustering can be used to group similar patterns of energy consumption based on their
                    similarity in terms of energy usage throughout the day.
